# Defining the PA
race as PA, problems:
- class imbalance, the privileged group is extremely underrepresented in the data
- the PA has more than two levels
possible solutions:
- use BORO as PA instead and dichotomize in (BRONX, QUEENS) : rest
- dichotomize race for class balance instead of sensible context (Black : rest)
- dichotomize race in whie : rest and use a resampling strategy to create more white observations


# General
For all the Yes-No binary variables 1 = yes, 0 = no

# Modelling
be careful about class-imbalance in one potential feature
