The raw dataset consists of 16971 observations and 82 variables. Around 41 percent
of these variables have more than 50 percent missing values. These variables
were discarded from the analysis and are mostly realted to ...?

Variable selection
First we excluded all the variables with more then 20\% missing values. 


% - number of stops conducted but with background information who governed at that time (see Obsidian)
% - transparent explanation of feature selection (similar to Data Transparanecy paper)
% - distribution of race in SQF data vs NYC
% - grouping to black, white, black hispanic, white hispanic, others --> arrestment rates vin these groups

Arrestment rate descrpition by race
There is the highest arrestment rate among white people and the lowest arrestment rate for black hispanic people
which at first glance could seem like there is no racial bias against people of color. In contrast, the high arrestment rate
suggest bias against white people. But the alternative explanation is that white people are selected more carefully,
leading to a higher proportion of white people that actually did something to arrest them.
